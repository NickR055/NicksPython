The VM I'm using is very outdated and the python is too. I have been on the struggle bus with mixing compatabilities but I believe it is fully working. I had no problem committing to github or writing the code. This VM is from hell though. My experience in VM's has been Microsoft Azure in TCMG303 which I would give an arm to use over this. I believe my mistake was not getting Ubuntu 18.04 in the initial install which has messed up the entire process.

Also while testing with a smaller amount of lines the code appears to work perfectly. When using the entire log file, the total logs retrieved might be 4 off and the total of 1995 logs might be 1 off. This could be due to my method of getting the count being F3'ing "/1995:" and "/1994:" but it is hard to tell the fine details with so much data.

Last update, it is 6am but I used a fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04 and it worked perfectly from a fresh clone. I believe if I started with this version of Ubuntu this would have been fairly easy. The coding took 15 minutes once in Python3, the github took 5 minutes, and figuring out the VM and python were old took hours.
